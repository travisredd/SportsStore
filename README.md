I had a problem when I published the site on azure it wouldn't format correctly. However, it did format correctly through IIS. You gave me a suggestion about possibly needing to update to version 2.2, you were correct. I updated to version 2.2 and everything seems to be working fine. 

I had problems with how to add migrations and update database. The book tells you the wrong way. Found out how and fixed that problem. Then I was getting an error because it said I had 2 dbContext It is because the database wasn't updated. All issues fixed.
